The annual BPM conference is the premium forum for researchers and practitioners in business process manageÂ­ment. BPM is a broad discipline, covering topics that range from formal methods in computer science, techniques in information systems engineering to management science methods. Therefore, not only different research topics are addressed, but also different research methods are employed that require different evaluation criteria in the peer reviewing process.

To accommodate for this diversity, the BPM conference introduced a new structure since the 2018 conference in Sydney. This structure is based on three tracks that cover not only different phenomena of interest and research methods but, consequently, also different evaluation criteria:

- *Track I* covers theoretical foundations,
- *Track II* engineering and
- *Track III* management.

To implement this structure, each track has a dedicated track chair and a dedicated program committee. The track chairs, together with a consolidation chair, are responsible for the scientific program. Through this structure we aim to broaden the BPM community and position the BPM conference as a forum for all aspects of the broad business process management discipline. Please refer to the [essay](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-98648-7_1) by Weske, Montali, Weber and vom Brocke on experiences with track structure in 2018.

Beyond the three tracks of the main conference, BPM 2025 includes the following program components:

- The Industry Forum to present practical insights and experiences on BPM,
- the Education Forum to cover topics related to the teaching of BPM and the applications of BPM for teaching,
- the Demonstration and Resources Forum to present innovative tools and prototypes as well as useful resources for the community,
- the Doctoral Consortium to tutor PhD students,
- Tutorials to teach recent BPM topics,
- various Workshops to discuss emerging BPM-related topics.
